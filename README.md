# Causal inference - Launch of ChatGPT on the number of non-farm job openings in the US

This project applies four causal inference methods—Causal Impact, PyMC Bayesian STS, Bayesian difference-in-differences, and DoWhy—to estimate the impact of ChatGPT's launch on U.S. job openings. All methods follow a unified approach: fitting models on pre-intervention data only, then extrapolating to create counterfactual predictions for the post-intervention period. The analysis incorporates multiple economic indicators as controls and provides a comprehensive comparison of results, visualizations, and methodological explanations, serving as both a practical application and an educational resource for causal inference in time series contexts.
